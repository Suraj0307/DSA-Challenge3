# Problem-Statement
Design a file compression algorithm that, when compared to existing methods, compresses a file into a smaller size in a fraction of the time while preserving information.

# Solution
The thoery behind behind this compression is too big and is not possible to explain here in the readme 
But by using datastructures we have managed to do it so.

## We have used Huffman Encoding technique to compress the data

## Data Structures Used: Hashmap,Heap,Binary Heap etc.
Check this youtube video to use it.
